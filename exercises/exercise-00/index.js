Intro:

    We are starting a small community of users. For performance
    reasons we have decided to store all users right in the code.
    This way we can provide our developers with more
    user-interaction opportunities. With user-related data, at least.
    All the GDPR-related issues we will solved some other day.
    This would be the base for our future experiments during
    this workshop.

Exercise:

    Given the data, define the interface "User" and use it accordingly.

Run this exercise:

    npm run 0

    - OR -

    yarn -s 0
